# Transient-Fault-Resiliency-using-Selective-Instruction-Duplication

Transient faults are becoming increasingly prevalent due
to the decreasing size of transistors and present a grow-
ing threat to device reliability. Research on dealing with
transient faults is widely divided into hardware-based and
software-based solutions. We present TFDR (Transient
Fault Duplication Resiliency), a software based solution for
transient fault resiliency using selective instruction duplica-
tion and multiple error recovery methods. We show that
TFDR provides high levels of protection when compared to
control binaries across several benchmarks. We also find the
associated size overheads to be fairly small when compared
to previous works
